// ========================================
// send a queued batch: the wallet popup, the outcomes, the report to the
// backend and the toast.
//
// --- WHY THE WALLET IS CALLED DIRECTLY AND NOT THROUGH THE TOOLBOX'S
// HELPER: `generic_contract_call_wallet` returns only the hashes and
// throws the outcome away. the outcome is the thing the queue records —
// "succeeded" or "failed" — so the app asks the wallet for the
// outcomes itself and reads both.
//
// --- WHY ONE POPUP FOR THE WHOLE BATCH: the batch is one offer of
// work. a reader who signs it signs all of it, and the wallet is
// asked for the whole list at once.
//
// --- WHY THE ACCOUNT COMES FROM THE API KEY: the request carries the
// reader's key and the backend knows the account. the body does not
// repeat it, because a body that named the account could name somebody
// else's.
//
// --- WHY THE BYTES ARE DECODED HERE AND NOT AT THE BACKEND: the
// wallet takes the BYTES. a contract like the FastFS protocol
// (`__fastdata_fastfs`) wants borsh bytes and not json, and the wallet
// that can carry them decodes the base64 into the exact bytes itself.
// so the base64 the queue holds is handed to the wallet as it is, and
// the wallet's native action does the decoding.
//
// --- WHY A CALL WITH BYTES GOES OUT A DIFFERENT WAY: near-connect
// converts every action into the connector shape, and the wallet's Rust
// writes those arguments out as json text, which the FastFS indexer
// cannot read. a call with bytes goes out through the wallet's
// `executor` instead, which posts the params straight to the wallet
// with no conversion. the shape of that route lives in
// shared/queue_args_wallet_action.ts.
