// ========================================
// the READING of a queued transaction's arguments.
//
// a queued transaction carries its arguments in one of two ways:
//
//   the JSON way   — `args` is a json object with named keys.
//   the BYTE way   — `argsBase64` is the raw bytes of the call, and
//                    the contract reads them itself.
//
// the byte way is what the FastFS protocol (`__fastdata_fastfs`) needs:
// it wants borsh bytes, and a json object cannot be borsh bytes.
//
// --- WHY --- THE READING IS HERE AND NOT IN THE COMPONENT: the queue
// page shows the arguments, and the feed's send path uses the bytes,
// and they must not drift on what the bytes are. one place reads them.
//
// --- WHY --- THE HEX PREVIEW AND NOT THE JSON: the bytes are not json,
// and printing them as json would show a reader a broken blob that
// says nothing. a hex preview says what the bytes are, and the length
// says how many there are.

//
// --- WHY --- THE BYTES ARE BUILT BY HAND: `Uint8Array.from` on a
// string gives the CODE POINTS of the string, not the bytes of the
// base64. the base64 is decoded to a binary string first, and each
// character of that string is one byte.

// hex. the length is shown beside it, so nothing is hidden — the
// reader knows how much there is.
