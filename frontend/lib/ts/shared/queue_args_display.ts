// what a queued call's arguments look like on screen.
//
// --- WHY THIS FILE IS ITS OWN ---
// a queued call can carry its arguments as JSON or as RAW BYTES, and the
// two look nothing alike on screen. the feed shows one line of json and
// the tx page shows a hex dump, and they must not disagree about what a
// call carries. one place reads the arguments.
//
// --- THE DISCONNECT THIS FIXES ---
// a FastFS call carries its bytes in `argsBase64`, and its `args` is an
// EMPTY object. the feed used to read only `args`, so a FastFS call showed
// NO arguments at all — no code block, nothing. the reader was asked to
// approve a call whose arguments were not on the page.
//
// a call with bytes now shows what the bytes are: the file's path, its
// mime type and its size, and the hex of the payload. that is the same
// information the queue page's FastFS widget shows, so the two agree.
