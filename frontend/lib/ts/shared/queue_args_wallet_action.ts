// queue_args_wallet_action.ts
// the wallet's ACTION shape for a queued call.
//
// --- WHY THIS FILE IS ITS OWN ---
// the shape of the arguments decides whether the bytes survive, and the
// reason is long enough that it needs a home of its own. this file makes
// the shape and explains what it has to be for each kind of call.
//
// --- THE TWO KINDS OF CALL ---
// a queued call carries its arguments one of two ways:
//
//   the JSON way — `args` is a json object with named keys.
//   the BYTE way — `argsBase64` is the raw bytes of the call, and the
//                  contract reads them itself.
//
// the byte way is what the FastFS protocol (`__fastdata_fastfs`) needs:
// it wants borsh bytes, and a json object cannot be borsh bytes.
//
// --- WHY THE BYTE WAY NEEDS A DIFFERENT ROUTE ---
// the indexer reads the action's args with `borsh::from_slice`, so the
// bytes have to reach the chain as bytes. a json object is not borsh,
// and a byte array that went through `JSON.stringify` is not borsh
// either — it becomes an object keyed by byte index.
//
// near-connect has exactly ONE way to hand a transaction to a wallet:
//
//   wallet.signAndSendTransactions({ transactions })
//
// and it runs every action through `nearActionsToConnectorActions`,
// which turns an action into the CONNECTOR shape:
//
//   { type: "FunctionCall", params: { methodName, args, gas, deposit } }
//
// that shape is fine for json arguments. for raw bytes it is not, and
// the reason is in the wallet's own Rust:
//
//   impl From<WalletSelectorAction> for NearAction {
//       ... args: serde_json::to_vec(&args).unwrap_or_default() ...
//   }
//
// the arguments are a `serde_json::Value` and they are SERIALIZED AS
// JSON. every json value serializes to text. a `Uint8Array` becomes the
// json text of a byte map and a base64 string becomes the json text of
// a string. neither is the file's bytes, so the indexer finds no borsh
// and DROPS THE ACTION SILENTLY: the receipt fails the way a FastFS
// receipt always fails, the file never appears at its url, and nothing
// anywhere says why.
//
// --- THE ROUTE THAT CARRIES BYTES ---
// the wallet has a second path, its NATIVE action, and it is tried
// FIRST because its action enum is untagged:
//
//   #[serde(untagged)]
//   enum SendTransactionsAction { Native(NearAction), WalletSelector(...) }
//
// the native action holds the arguments as bytes:
//
//   pub struct FunctionCallAction {
//       pub method_name: String,
//       #[serde_as(as = "Base64")]
//       pub args: Vec<u8>,     // base64 in json -> RAW BYTES on chain
//       ...
//   }
//
// so the native path decodes the base64 into the exact bytes, and those
// go on chain verbatim.
//
// the native path is UNREACHABLE through near-connect's own methods,
// because `nearActionsToConnectorActions` refuses an action it does not
// recognize:
//
//   if ("type" in action) return action;      // passthrough
//   if (action.functionCall) { ...convert... }
//   throw new Error("Unsupported action type");
//
// a native action has no `type` key, so it hits the throw. and adding a
// `type` key does not help: the native variant is an EXTERNALLY TAGGED
// enum, so a sibling `type` key makes serde look for a variant named
// `type` and fail with
//
//   unknown variant `type`, expected `FunctionCall`
//
// we compiled the wallet's exact serde types and ran them:
//
//   native, no type key            -> OK Native, raw bytes, first 0x00
//   native WITH type key           -> ERR unknown variant `type`
//   wallet-selector, args a string -> OK, but the args become JSON text
//   wallet-selector, args an array -> OK, but the args become JSON text
//
// --- THE WAY THROUGH ---
// the wallet's `executor` is a PUBLIC field, and the executor posts its
// params straight to the wallet iframe as JSON, with NO conversion:
//
//   async call(method, params) { ... iframe.postMessage({ method, params, id }) ... }
//
// so calling the executor directly skips the conversion, and the native
// action reaches the wallet untouched. `executor.call` with the method
// `wallet:signAndSendTransactions` takes the WHOLE BATCH, so this route
// keeps the one-popup-for-the-batch behaviour the app has.
//
// so: a call with bytes goes out as a native action through the
// executor, and a call with json goes out as the connector shape
// through the wallet's own method.

// we tested an upload with, end to end, on mainnet.
//
// --- WHY THE OTHERS ARE NOT ON THE LIST --- the browser-signer wallets
// — MyNearWallet, OKX, Nightly, HOT Wallet — borsh-serialize the whole
// transaction in the browser, so the bytes survive the connector shape
// too. but their raw-byte route has not been tested here, and a
// FastFS upload that is DROPPED SILENTLY is worse than one that is
// refused out loud. a wallet added to this list needs its own test.

//
// --- WHY --- THE GAS AND THE DEPOSIT ARE THE RAW NUMBERS: the queue

//
// --- WHY --- THE ARGS ARE BASE64: the native action holds its arguments

// json string would come out quoted, and those quotes are bytes on chain.
