// ========================================
// the feed's ONE call line: the first transaction of the post, its args,
// and the token it moves when it moves one.
//
// --- WHY THE POST SHOWS ONLY THE FIRST CALL: the post is SMALL. it
// answers "is this worth my attention?" and the queue page answers
// "exactly what is this?". a post that carried every transaction would
// be a wall of text, and a feed of walls is not a feed.
//
// --- WHY THE CONTRACT AND THE METHOD ARE ALWAYS ON THEIR OWN LINE AND
// ALWAYS THE SAME WAY: the post reads the same for every kind of call.
// a line that changed shape depending on whether the call moved a token
// would be a line the reader had to learn twice.
//
// --- WHY THE ARGS ARE ALWAYS SHOWN AND FLATTENED: the reader is about
// to SIGN this. the contract and the method say what is called; the
// args say what it is called WITH. a post that showed the amount but
// not the args would leave the reader signing something they have not
// read.
//
// --- WHY THE ARGS ARE FLATTENED TO ONE LINE: the args are a json
// object, and json printed across several lines is a block of code the
// reader has to parse. flattened, it is one line of `key=value` pairs
// that reads like the call it describes.
//
// --- WHY THE TOKEN DETAILS ARE ON A LINE OF THEIR OWN: they are a
// DIFFERENT kind of thing from the args. the args are what the call
// asks for; the token line is what that means in money — the icon, the
// amount, the symbol and the worth. they are the only part of the post
// that needs the token registry.
//
// --- WHY THE RENDERING IS THE SHARED ONE: the token's icon, the amount
// divided by its decimals, the symbol and the usd worth all come from
// the shared transfer amount component. a queued transfer and a
// finished transfer must read identically.
//
// --- WHY IT DOES NOT SELF-MOUNT: the call line is drawn INSIDE the
// post, once per post. a mount element would be the same id on every
// post, so the component takes the post as a prop and the post's own
// css file carries the rules — see
// SHIT_1170_COMPONENT_APP_PAGE_FEED_TRANSACTIONS.css.
