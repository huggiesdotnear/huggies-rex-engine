// ========================================
// one post in the feed: the WHAT, the one call line, the WHO chips, the
// reader's status and the actions.
//
// the post is SMALL on purpose: it answers "is this worth my attention?"
// and the queue page answers "exactly what is this?".
//
// --- WHY THE POSTS ARE ONE LIST AND NOT TWO: the reader reads one
// feed. two lists would mean two scrolls, two "nothing here" messages
// and two orders to think about. one list, two kinds of card.
//
// --- WHY THE WHAT IS THE HEADLINE: it is the agent's own sentence
// about the batch, and it is the one thing about a batch that needs no
// explaining.
//
// --- WHY THE FIRST CALL IS SHOWN AND NOT THE METHOD NAME ALONE: a
// queued `ft_transfer` carries a token amount, and that is the most
// useful thing on the card.
//
// --- WHY THE WHO ARE CHIPS AND NOT A COUNT: a count says "2 accounts"
// and tells the reader nothing about whether they are one of them. a
// chip with their own id on it tells them at a glance.
//
// --- WHY THE JOIN BUTTON IS ONE BUTTON: it says what it will do. if
// your account is on the queue and has not sent it, the button says
// DECLINE. if it is not on the queue, it says ADD. if you have already
// sent it, there is nothing to join and nothing to decline, so the
// button is gone and the status takes its place.
//
// --- WHY ADD IS HIDDEN WHEN THE READER IS SIGNED OUT: a button that
// cannot work is noise.
//
// --- WHY THE BUTTONS ARE APPROVE, DECLINE AND DETAILS IN THAT ORDER:
// the reader's eye goes to the first button, and the first button is
// the one that does the work. the DECLINE is the way out and the
// DETAILS is the record, and the same order is on the swap card, so
// the two kinds of card are read the same way.
