// ========================================
// the queue page's FastFS card: what a queued FastFS upload IS.
//
// a queued upload is not signed yet, so nothing is indexed and there is
// no file at any link. this card shows the file's FACTS — its name, its
// type, its size, and for a partial upload the chunk, the offset and
// the nonce — and the problems the indexer will drop it for.
//
// --- WHY THE CARD IS ITS OWN AND NOT THE TX PAGE'S: the tx page shows
// the SERVED file, with the link it is served at and the preview that
// link loads. this page shows what the batch asks to put up, and a
// queued upload has no served file yet. the two cards are not one card
// with a switch on, so this one lives in the queue page's folder.
//
// --- WHY THERE IS NO LINK AND NO NOTE ABOUT A LINK: the file is not
// indexed until the batch is signed, so a link here is a link to
// nothing, and a note about a link to nothing is noise on a page that
// is about what the batch will do. the queue page shows the file's
// facts and leaves the served file to the transaction page.
//
// --- WHY THERE IS NO PREVIEW: the preview is the file itself, drawn
// from the served link. there is no served link here, and what the
// queue page answers is what the file IS, not what it looks like.
//
// --- WHY THE LIMIT PROBLEMS ARE HERE: the indexer drops what breaks
// its rules SILENTLY, so a payload that breaks them describes a file
// that will never land. the problem has to be visible somewhere, and
// here is where the reader is looking.
//
// this component does NOT fetch. it renders what it is given.
