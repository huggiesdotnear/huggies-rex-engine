// ========================================
// the transaction page's widgets: the sections that show ONE KIND OF
// THING the transaction did, and that show it only when the transaction
// actually did it.
//
// a widget is not a section of the page. the page's sections and their
// order are a fact about the page — the transfers sit above the files,
// the actions sit below them — and they do not change because a widget
// was added. the registry decides WHICH widgets apply to a transaction.
// the page decides WHERE they go.
//
// --- WHY --- THE REGISTRY DECIDES WHICH AND NOT WHERE: the page mounts
// each section into its own `<div>`, and the order of those divs is the
// page's layout. a registry that also carried the position would put a
// widget's PLACE in the registry, and then where a widget sits would be
// decided by where it happened to be registered — the order of the
// imports would become the order of the page. the order of the page is
// a decision, and it is the page's decision.
//
// --- WHY --- THERE IS NO DEFAULT AND NO RAW WIDGET: the fastnear
// explorer shows the same transfer twice — once in its TRANSFERS
// section, which comes from the log events, and once in its own
// ft-transfer widget, which comes from the action. the section reads
// what the chain's books say and the widget reads what the call asked
// for, and for one transaction they are the same fact twice. a reader
// sees one transfer here and one transfer there and cannot tell whether
// they are two transfers or one. so the transfers widget is ours and it
// is the ONLY one, and it comes from the log events.
//
// the RAW ACTION IS NOT A WIDGET EITHER: the actions section stays
// exactly what it is — the raw action and its arguments — because the
// raw action is the thing the chain signed and it is not a summary of
// anything.
//
// --- WHY --- `match` READS THE PARSED TRANSACTION: a widget decides
// whether it applies by looking at FACTS — the parsed actions and the
// transfers the client gave — and not at the DOM. a widget that asked
// the page what is on screen would be a widget about the page's markup,
// and it would break the moment the page moved a div.
//
// --- WHY --- THE WIDGETS ARE FROZEN ONES AND THE REGISTRY IS NOT: a
// widget's own fields cannot change after it is registered, so a
// consumer cannot swap a widget's `match` under the page's feet. the
// registry itself takes new widgets, so a widget can be added without
// touching this file.

// --- REGISTRY --------------------------
// the widgets that are registered.
//
// --- WHY --- A LIST AND NOT A MAP: the widgets are looked up by what
// they match, not by name — the page asks "which widgets apply?" and
// not "give me the widget called transfers". a list keeps the order the
// widgets were registered in, which is a fact about the registry and
// not about the page.

// --- MATCHERS --------------------------
// the transfers widget applies when the transaction moved something.
//
// --- WHY --- BOTH LISTS ARE ASKED FOR: a fungible transfer and an nft
// transfer are different things on the chain, and a transaction can
// carry one and not the other. a transaction that moved only an nft
// still moved something, and it still belongs under TRANSFERS.

  return parsed.transfers.length > 0 || parsed.nft_transfers.length > 0;

// the decoded FastFS upload on the call it belongs to, so the uploads
// are found by looking for that — the same fact the files widget reads
// when it draws its rows.

// --- REGISTER -------------------------
// add a widget to the registry.
//
// --- WHY --- A WIDGET WITH AN ID THAT IS ALREADY TAKEN IS REFUSED: the
// id is how a consumer names a widget, and two widgets under one name
// would make the name ambiguous. a duplicate is a mistake, and a
// mistake that shows up as a page with the wrong widget is worse than a
// mistake that shows up here.
//
// --- WHY --- THE REGISTRY IS REPLACED AND NOT PUSHED INTO: the exported
// registry is frozen, so a consumer cannot push into it. the new list
// is built and frozen again, and the exported one is replaced with it.
// what a consumer holds is never a list that is still being written to.
//
// --- WHY --- THE NAME IS THE REGISTRY'S OWN ACTION: a widget that wants
// to be on the page registers itself, and it asks for the one function
// that does that.

// sees the same registry, whatever was registered when it asked.

//
// --- WHY --- THE MATCH IS TRIED ON EVERY WIDGET AND NONE OF THEM CAN
// BREAK THE PAGE: a widget's `match` reads the parsed transaction, and
// a widget that throws would take the whole page down. the throw is
// caught and the widget is skipped — a widget that cannot decide is a
// widget that does not apply.
//
// --- WHY --- THE NAME IS THE REGISTRY'S OWN QUESTION: the registry's
// job is to say which widgets apply, and this is the function that says
// it.

  }
  return matching;
}

// does the widget with this id apply to this transaction.
//
// --- WHY --- THE ASK IS "DOES THIS WIDGET APPLY" AND NOT "IS THIS
// WIDGET REGISTERED": a widget's own component asks whether it applies
// to the transaction on screen. whether the widget is REGISTERED is a
// different question — a widget can be registered and still not apply
// to this transaction, and then it shows nothing.

// --- THE WIDGETS -----------------------

//
// --- WHY --- THEY ARE REGISTERED HERE AND NOT IN THE PAGE: the page
// imports the widgets' own components, and a component that registered
// itself would depend on the order the imports ran in. the registry is
// written down once, and the page reads it.
//
// --- WHY --- THE LABELS ARE THE PAGE'S OWN WORDS: a widget's label is
// what the page calls it, and the page's words are the ones the reader
// sees. the label is here so the name of the thing and the name the
// reader knows it by are one fact and not two.
