// ========================================
// the transaction page's FastFS card: what a FastFS upload that already
// happened IS.
//
// a FastFS upload is a function call to `__fastdata_fastfs` whose
// arguments are RAW BORSH BYTES. the client decodes those bytes into a
// file's facts, and this card shows them — the name, the type, the
// size — the link the file is served at, and a preview of it when the
// type allows one.
//
// --- WHY THE CARD IS GIVEN THE DECODED FILE AND NOT THE BYTES: the
// caller has to decode the bytes anyway — the transaction page's parser
// has already decoded them — so the decode happens ONCE, in the
// caller's hands, and the card is given the result. the card is about
// what a file IS, and how to show one, and not about what the bytes
// are.
//
// --- WHY THE DECODER IS THE CLIENT'S AND NOT A COPY HERE: the queue
// page shows a QUEUED upload, before it is signed, and the transaction
// page shows an ON-CHAIN one. the two must read the same bytes the
// same way, and two decoders drift. the fastnear client owns the borsh
// rules, so both pages ask it what the bytes mean.
//
// --- WHY THE CARD IS NOT SHARED WITH THE QUEUE PAGE: the queue page
// asks what the file IS — its facts, and nothing else — while this page
// shows the SERVED file, with the link it is served at and the preview
// that link loads. the two are not the same card with a switch on, and
// one card with a switch is two cards wearing one coat. so the queue
// page has its own card, in its own folder, and this one belongs to
// the page that shows the live file.
//
// --- WHY THE CARD IS ITS OWN COMPONENT AND NOT A BLOCK IN THE WIDGET:
// the rules about what the served file shows — what a preview needs,
// what the link means, what the indexer will drop — are a set of their
// own, and one copy of them is one copy to keep true.
//
// --- WHY THE PREVIEW ONLY WORKS ON-CHAIN: the file is served by the
// FastData indexer, and the indexer only knows about a file after the
// transaction is on chain. this page shows an ON-CHAIN upload, so the
// url has the file at it.
//
// --- WHY THE LIMIT PROBLEMS ARE HERE: the indexer drops what breaks
// its rules SILENTLY, so a payload that breaks them describes a file
// that will never land. the problem has to be visible somewhere, and
// here is where the reader is looking.
//
// --- WHY THE RECEIPT IS NOT ARGUED ABOUT HERE: a FastFS call fails on
// purpose — the receiver has no contract and does not need one, so the
// receipt comes back with `CodeDoesNotExist`. that fact is in the
// skill and in the docs. the page does not need to argue with the
// reader about it.
//
// this component does NOT fetch. it renders what it is given.
