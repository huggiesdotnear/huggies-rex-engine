// ========================================
// SHIT_1170_TX_QUEUE
// the shapes of our own tx queue routes, under /api/shit-1170/tx-queue.
//
// a QUEUE is a BATCH of transactions, not one transaction. the agent
// queues a swap that needs three calls, they go in together under one
// queue_id, and the user signs them as one batch in one wallet popup.
//
// the model is three levels deep:
//
//   a QUEUE  (queue_id)          what / when / why
//     └── a TRANSACTION          contractId / method / args / gas / deposit
//           └── an ACCOUNT ROW    accountId / status / txHash
//
// --- WHY --- the fields are camelCase: they mirror the browser's own
// session object (`accountId`), and the near-kit toolbox's transaction
// object, so a queued transaction can be handed to
// `generic_contract_call_wallet` without being reshaped.
//
// --- WHY --- `args` is a json OBJECT and not a string: the toolbox
// takes a json object of arguments. a string would make the frontend
// parse it and then re-serialize it.
//
// --- WHY --- there is no status on the queue and none on the
// transaction: the truth is on the account row. a queue is never done —
// any account may still send it — so there is nothing for a queue
// status to say, and two accounts sending the same queued transaction
// produce two different on-chain transactions with two different
// outcomes.
// ========================================

// where one account stands with one transaction.
//
// --- WHY --- four states and not two: `sent` means "it went out and
// nobody knows how it went yet", which is the real state of a
// transaction the moment the wallet signs it. `succeeded` and `failed`
// come later, when the outcome is read off the chain.
