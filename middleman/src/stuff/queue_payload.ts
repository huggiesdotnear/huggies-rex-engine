// the shape the engine's tx-queue accepts.
//
// the agent NEVER sends a transaction. it builds a payload and the
// engine queues it for a human to sign in the web app.
//
// this is NOT a near-kit transaction and NOT a `near.call`. it is
// data.
//
// --- WHY --- IT IS HERE AND NOT IN A SKILL: a queue payload is the
// engine's own wire shape, and the engine's wire shapes live with the
// engine's typed client. a skill that builds a payload should build it
// from the same place the engine documents it, so the two cannot drift.
//
// --- WHY --- THE VALIDATION IS HERE: a payload the engine cannot
// trust is a payload that moves the wrong thing. an empty contract id,
// an empty method, an args that is not an object, an args that is not
// base64, and a gas or deposit that is not a raw digit string are all
// refused at build time, where the mistake is still visible.
// ========================================
