// ========================================
// TX_QUEUE_STORE
// the db access for the tx_queue table. every read and every write of a
// queued batch goes through this file, so the sql lives in one place.
//
// --- WHY --- one row per BATCH and not per transaction: the agent
// queues a swap, and that swap needs three function calls — a deposit,
// the swap itself, and a withdrawal — so they go in together under one
// `queue_id`, and the user signs them as one batch, in one wallet popup.
//
// --- WHY --- the `what`, `when` and `why` live on the QUEUE and not on
// the transaction rows: they describe the batch, not one call. "swap 100
// USDC for NEAR" is the what of three calls taken together.
//
// --- WHY --- there is NO status column on this table: a queue is never
// done. at any moment another account can decide they want to send it,
// and they join. the status lives on the account row and nowhere else.
//
// --- WHY --- the `when` column is QUOTED in every statement that reads
// or writes it: `when` is a reserved word in sqlite, and an unquoted
// `when` in a column list is a syntax error. `why` and `when_at` are
// ordinary words and are left alone.

// --- LIST ------------------------------
// the queue list, and how many queues matched before the limit took its

//
// --- WHY --- the total is a SECOND statement and not a window function
// over the page: the total is the count of the WHOLE match, so it has to
// be counted before the limit cut it. a window function would count only
// the rows that survived.
//
// --- WHY --- the filters are OPTIONAL binds and the same `?1` is written
// THREE times: the account id is wanted in the `EXISTS` and again in the
// `NOT EXISTS`. sqlx's sqlite driver reads the bind parameter NAMES off
// the statement, and when a name is `?NNN` it binds argument NNN to that
// slot — so `?1` means "argument one" and it can be written as many times
// as the query wants. a plain `?` would be positional and could not be
// reused.
//
// --- WHY --- the optional filters bind an `Option` and are tested with
// `?1 IS NULL`: `None` means "this filter was not given" and the clause
// is skipped. that is why one statement serves every shape of the list
// and there is no second sql to keep in step with the first.
//
// --- WHY --- `hide_sent` needs the account: "has this account sent it"
// is a question about ONE account. a queue can be sent by alice and not
// by bob, so there is no such question about all the accounts at once.
// when the caller gives a `hide_sent` with no account, the `NOT EXISTS`
// never matches anything that account did and the filter falls away —
// the ROUTE is where that is refused, because the route knows it was a
// mistake and the store only knows the shape of the data.
//
// --- WHY --- the contract and the method filters use `EXISTS` over the
// TRANSACTIONS and not over the account rows: a queue holds a
// transaction for a contract even when nobody has sent it yet, and the
// queue is what the filter is about.
//
// --- WHY --- the order is `created_at DESC`: the list is a feed, and the
// newest batch is the one the reader wants.
//
// --- WHY --- THE ORDER IS `(created_at DESC, queue_id DESC)` AND NOT
// JUST `created_at DESC`: two batches can be queued in the same
// millisecond, and the cursor that walks this order needs a total one.
// the id breaks the tie in the same direction as the time, so "the rows
// after this one" is one comparison and not two.
//
// --- WHY --- THE CURSOR IS `(created_at, queue_id) < (?, ?)` AND NOT A
// ROWID: the rowid moves when the db is vacuumed, and the cursor has
// to survive that. the pair is what the row is identified by.
