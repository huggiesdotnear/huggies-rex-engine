// ========================================
// TX_QUEUE_ROW_TO_JSON_FUN
// the three db rows become ONE wire shape.
//
// a queued batch is three levels deep — a QUEUE, the TRANSACTIONS inside
// it, and the ACCOUNT ROWS under those — and the wire shape is one flat
// json object holding all three. this file is where they are joined.
//
// --- WHY --- this is its own file: the wire shape is written down ONCE.
// the queue route, the one-batch route and the list route all answer
// with the same shape, and if each of them built it by hand one of them
// would eventually build it differently. the db rows are snake_case and
// the wire is camelCase, and the rename happens here.
//
// --- WHY --- the queue's `accounts` list is the WHO across the WHOLE
// BATCH — the union of the transactions' account rows: a batch of three
// calls has three account rows for alice, and the queue's list holds
// ONE entry for alice, not three. the transaction's own list holds that
// transaction's rows, with that transaction's status and hash.
//
// --- WHY --- the WHO list is DEDUPED by account id: the queue's list is
// one entry per account. a row that carries a hash and a row that does
// not are the same account, and the one WITH the hash is the newer
// truth — so the row with the hash wins.

// --- TO JSON ---------------------------
// the wire shape of one queued batch.
//
// --- WHY --- the args blob is parsed and NOT passed through as a string:
// the wire shape of the args is a json object, and the column holds it
// as a string. the conversion lives in `tx_queue_args_fun`, so the two
// directions can never disagree.
//
// --- WHY --- a blob that will not parse is an ERROR and not an empty
// object: a call whose arguments are gone must not be answered with
// arguments that were never there. the caller turns the error into a 500.
