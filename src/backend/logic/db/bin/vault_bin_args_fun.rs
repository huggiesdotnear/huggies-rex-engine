// ========================================
// VAULT_BIN_ARGS_FUN
// the flags every vault bin takes, and the parser that reads them.
//
// --- WHY --- there is NO clap and NO arg-parser crate: the bins take a
// handful of flags, and a dependency for that would be more code than
// the parser itself. the parser here is the whole thing.
//
// --- WHY --- the db path is a FLAG and not an argument: the db lives in
// a different place in docker than it does at home, and the flag says
// which one. the flag wins over the env var, and the env var wins over
// the default path — the same order the app uses.
//
// --- WHY --- the flags are COLLECTED and not validated here: each bin
// knows which flags it takes and what they mean, and a shared parser
// that knows every bin's flags would know too much.
//
// --- WHY --- an unknown flag is an ERROR and not a warning: a typo in a
// flag that says "--older-then 30" would otherwise run a prune with NO
// age filter and take everything. a bin that deletes rows has to fail
// loudly on a flag it does not know.
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::path::PathBuf;
// ========================================
// --- TYPES ------------------------------
// the flags a bin was called with.
//
// --- WHY --- the values are STRINGS and not typed: each bin parses its
// own values, because "30" is thirty days in one bin and a unix second
// in another, and the shared parser cannot know which.

pub struct VAULT_BIN_ARGS {
    // the db file's path, when `--db` was given.
    pub db_path: Option<PathBuf>,
    // the flags that were given, by name, without the `--`.
    pub flags: HashMap<String, String>,
    // the flags that were given with no value, like `--confirm`.

// ========================================
// --- PARSE -----------------------------
// read the words of the command line into the flags.
//
// --- WHY --- `--flag value` and `--flag=value` BOTH work: the first is
// how people type things and the second is how scripts write them.
// accepting one and not the other would make every script break.
//
// --- WHY --- a `--flag` at the END of the line with nothing after it is a
// SWITCH and not a flag with an empty value: `--confirm` alone is the
// common case, and an empty value would have to be special-cased by
// every bin.
//
// --- WHY --- a `--` ENDS the flags: everything after it is positional.
// a path that starts with a dash is then possible.
//
// --- WHY --- an unknown flag is NOT an error HERE but is caught by the
// bin: the parser collects everything, and each bin checks the names it
// knows. this way the parser stays one thing for all the bins.
//
// --- WHY --- the value of `--flag value` is taken even when it starts
// with a dash: `--db --weird` is the caller's mistake, and a db path
// that starts with a dash is rarer than a typo. the bin's own checks
// catch the mistake.
