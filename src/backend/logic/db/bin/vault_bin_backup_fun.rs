// VAULT_BIN_BACKUP_FUN
// a copy of the db file that is safe to take while the app is running.
//
// --- WHY --- `VACUUM INTO` AND NOT A FILE COPY: a sqlite file in WAL
// mode is three files — the db, the `-wal` and the `-shm` — and a plain
// copy of the db file alone is a db with the recent writes left out.
// copying it while a write is in flight can copy a half-written page.
// `VACUUM INTO` asks sqlite itself to write a fresh, whole, consistent
// copy, and it takes the lock it needs while it does it.
//
// --- WHY --- THE COPY GOES NEXT TO THE ORIGINAL and not to a temp dir:
// the copy is of the vault, and the vault's folder is where the person
// who made it will look for it.
//
// --- WHY --- THE NAME CARRIES THE TIME: two backups in the same second
// would collide, and the second one would overwrite the first.

// ========================================
// --- BACKUP ---------------------------
// write a consistent copy of the db next to it.
//
// --- WHY --- THE DESTINATION IS BUILT HERE and not taken from the
// caller: the name has the time in it, and a caller that built the name
// would have to build the same name the same way.
//
// --- WHY --- THE COPY IS CHECKED FOR EXISTENCE FIRST: `VACUUM INTO`
// fails if the file is there, and it fails with a message that does not
// say which file. the check says it plainly.
//
// --- WHY --- THE ORIGINAL IS NOT TOUCHED: the backup is a read of the
// vault and a write of a new file. the vault is the thing that matters.
