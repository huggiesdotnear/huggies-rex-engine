// VAULT_BIN_LIST_FUN
// what is in a vault: the queues, the swaps and the api keys, with the
// counts that say how big each one is.
//
// --- WHY --- IT IS A SEPARATE BIN and not a flag on the prune: the
// question "what is in here" is asked on its own, all the time, and it
// is the question to ask BEFORE a prune. a prune that prints its plan
// answers it, but only for the rows the filters matched.
//
// --- WHY --- THE COUNTS ARE READ IN ONE QUERY each and not one query
// per row: a vault with a thousand queues and a query per queue is a
// thousand queries, and the whole point of the list is to be quick
// enough to run while you think.

// DISTINCT. a subquery counts the rows it is asked about and nothing
// else.
//
// --- WHY --- THE COUNTED ROWS ARE THE ACCOUNT ROWS of the queue: the
// account row is the one place the status lives, so "how many sent it"
// is a count over the rows that carry a hash.
