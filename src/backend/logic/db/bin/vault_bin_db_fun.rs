// ========================================
// VAULT_BIN_DB_FUN
// how a bin opens the db file it was pointed at.
//
// --- WHY --- the bins open the db DIRECTLY and not through the app's
// `db_open_fun`: the app's opener runs the schema creates, which is
// right for the app and wrong for a bin. a bin that reads a vault must
// NOT create tables in it, and a bin that must not touch a db at all
// must fail on a db with no schema instead of quietly making one.
//
// --- WHY --- the path resolution is THE SAME ORDER as the app's: the
// `--db` flag wins, the env var wins over the default, and the default
// is the home folder path. so a bin with no flag on the same machine
// as the app reads the app's db.
//
// --- WHY --- the db is opened READ-WRITE for every bin: the read-only
// bins need a write-capable connection for the backup api, and the
// write bins obviously need one. the file's own mode is what protects
// it, not the connection.
use sqlx::SqlitePool;
use sqlx::sqlite::{SqliteConnectOptions, SqlitePoolOptions};
use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};
use std::time::Duration;
// ========================================
// --- CONFIG -----------------------------
// how long a statement waits for the write lock before giving up.
//
// --- WHY --- it is SHORTER than the app's: a bin is a one-shot command
// and a person is waiting for it. a busy db means the app is writing,
// and the bin should say so instead of hanging.
const VAULT_BIN_BUSY_TIMEOUT: Duration = Duration::from_secs(5);
// ========================================
// --- PATH -------------------------------
// the db file's path, from the flag when it was given, and from the app's
// own resolution otherwise.
//
// --- WHY --- THE APP'S FUNCTION IS CALLED AND NOT COPIED: the env var
// and the default path are read in one place in the app, and a second
// copy of that rule would be a second thing to keep in step.

}

// ========================================
// --- OPEN -------------------------------
// open the db at the path, without touching its schema.
//
// --- WHY --- `create_if_missing` is OFF: a bin pointed at a db that is
// not there must say "there is no db at that path" and stop. creating
// an empty db would be a bin that quietly made a new file where the
// real one should have been.
//
// --- WHY --- the parent folder is NOT created either: same reason.
//
// --- WHY --- WAL is set like the app sets it: a db written by the app
// is in WAL mode, and a bin that opened it in a different mode would
// change the file's format behind the app's back.
//
// --- WHY --- `foreign_keys` is ON: the deletes rely on the cascade, and
// a bin that deleted the parent rows and left the children behind would
// leave a broken db.
