// ========================================
// VAULT_BIN_PRUNE_FUN
// what to delete from a vault: the filters, the plan, and the delete.
//
// --- WHY --- the plan and the delete are TWO STEPS: the first says what
// would go and the second takes it. a bin that deletes rows must be
// able to show the plan before it acts, and the plan must be built by
// the same code that does the deleting, so the two cannot disagree.
//
// --- WHY --- THE QUEUE IS DELETED AND NOT THE ACCOUNT ROWS: the
// account rows hang off the transactions and the transactions hang off
// the queue, all with ON DELETE CASCADE. deleting the queue takes its
// transactions and their account rows with it, in one statement, and the
// db's own rules do the work.
//
// --- WHY --- "NEVER SENT" IS ABOUT THE ACCOUNT ROWS and not about the
// queue: the status lives on the account row and nowhere else. a queue
// is never done, so "was this queue ever sent" is really "did any
// account on it ever send". the filter looks for queues where NO
// account row carries a hash.
//
// --- WHY --- A QUEUE THAT WAS SENT IS LEFT WHOLE unless `--include-sent`
// is given: a row that carries a hash is HISTORY — it shows who did the
// transaction and it stays. so the default prune skips a queue that any
// account has sent, and the flag says "take that history too". there is
// no half measure that keeps the account row and drops its transaction,
// because that would leave the row pointing at nothing.

// --- TYPES ------------------------------
// the filters that say what to delete.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default)]
pub struct VAULT_PRUNE_FILTERS {
    // only the queues and swaps older than this many days.
    pub older_than_days: Option<u32>,
    // only the queues and swaps created before this moment, in epoch ms.
    pub before_ms: Option<i64>,
    // only the queues and swaps created after this moment, in epoch ms.
    pub after_ms: Option<i64>,
    // only the queues and swaps where NO account ever sent.

    pub account_id: Option<String>,

    //
    // --- WHY --- THE SWAPS ARE OPTIONAL: a prune that names a queue id

    // asked for one thing took another, and the swap would have matched
    // only by its age, which is not what was asked for.

}
// ========================================
// --- PLAN ------------------------------
// what would be deleted.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default)]

    // the queue ids that would go.

    pub swap_account_rows: u64,
}
// ========================================
// --- BIND ------------------------------
// a value to bind into a where clause.
//
// --- WHY --- THE BIND IS ITS OWN TYPE and not a plain string: the filter
// values come from a command line, and a value that goes into a query as
// text is a way to run a query the caller did not ask for. the bind says
// what kind of value it is so sqlite is told the truth about it.
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum SqlxBind {
    // an integer.
    Int(i64),
    // a string.
    Text(String),
}

// ========================================
// --- WHERE -----------------------------
// the `where` clause that matches the queues, and the binds it needs.
//
// --- WHY --- the clause is BUILT as a string and the values are BOUND:
// the filter values come from a command line, and a value that goes into
// a query as text is a way to run a query the caller did not ask for.
//
// --- WHY --- `EXISTS` for the never-sent filter and not a join: the
// filter asks whether there is NO account row with a hash, and that is
// a question about the absence of a row.
//
// --- WHY --- THE SENT ROWS ARE EXCLUDED UNLESS `--include-sent` IS
// GIVEN: the same history rule as the delete routes. the `NOT EXISTS`
// is the whole rule, and without the flag a queue that any account has
// sent does not match at all.
//
// --- WHY --- the account filter is an `EXISTS` over the account rows of
// the queue: the account may be on ONE transaction of the batch and not
// on the others, and "the queues this account is on" is the question.
