// ========================================
// DB_SCHEMA_RUN_FUN
// runs the table creates: the one file that knows how many tables there
// are.
//
// --- WHY --- there is NO migration system here. a migration system exists
// so a db's schema can be CHANGED over time: each change is a numbered
// step, the db records which steps it has run, and a fresh db runs them
// all in order.
//
// this db has four tables of its own and four settled shapes for them.
// so there is nothing to step through and nothing to remember. what is
// left is the schema itself and the statements that create it.
//
// --- WHY --- the tables are NOT versioned per row: a `format_version`
// column would let a new shape be written beside an old one and the old
// one ignored. that is worth doing when a shape changes often enough
// for the old rows to pile up, and it is not worth doing for tables whose
// shapes are settled. a changed shape means changing the table file.
//
// --- WHY --- the schema lives in code and not in a folder of .sql files:
// the schema has to travel with the binary. a file the docker image does
// not carry is a file the app cannot open.
//
// --- WHY --- the tables are created in DEPENDENCY ORDER: `tx_queue` has
// to exist before `tx_queue_transactions` points at it, and
// `tx_queue_transactions` has to exist before `tx_queue_accounts` points
// at it. sqlite does not check a foreign key's target when the table is
// created, but the order still has to be right for the rows that follow
// and for a reader of the code.
//
// --- WHY --- each table file holds its own `CREATE TABLE` and its own
// indexes, and this file holds nothing but the order: a table's shape is
// read in one place, and this is the only file that says how many tables
// there are.
//
// --- WHY --- A COLUMN THAT WAS ADDED LATER IS A DIFFERENT THING: a
// `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` does nothing to a table that already
// exists, so a db that was made before a column was added would never
// get it. there is still no migration system — no numbered steps and no
// record of which steps have run — but a column is added by an
// `ALTER TABLE` that checks whether the column is already there, and it
// runs on every start. the check is what makes it safe to run every
// time: the statement runs only when the column is missing.
use sqlx::{Connection, Executor, SqliteConnection};
// ========================================
// --- RUN -------------------------------
// create every table if it is not there yet.
//
// --- WHY --- it runs on every start: the statements do nothing when the
// tables already exist, so there is no bookkeeping to say "already done"
// and no state to get out of step with the schema.
//
// --- WHY --- it runs in ONE transaction: a half-created schema would fail
// the first query against it. one transaction means either every table is
// there or none of them is.
//
// --- WHY --- the table creates are called with the SAME connection and
// NOT in a nested transaction of their own: a transaction cannot be
// started inside another transaction. so the table files expose their
// statement as a constant and the runner executes them itself.
