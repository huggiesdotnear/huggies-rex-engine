// ========================================
// DB
// everything that touches the sqlite database.
//
// --- WHY --- these live together: the pool, the schema that creates
// the tables and the path the db file sits at are three halves of one
// thing — the storage. a change to any of them is a change to how the
// app stores its data, so they belong in one folder.
//
// --- WHY --- one file per table: a table's shape is read in one place.
// `db_schema_run_fun` holds the order and runs them, and it is the only
// file that knows how many tables there are.
