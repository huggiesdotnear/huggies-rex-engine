// ========================================
// DB_TABLE_TX_QUEUE_TRANSACTIONS_FUN
// the tx_queue_transactions table: one row per transaction inside a
// queued batch.
//
// --- WHY --- only FUNCTION CALLS can be queued: no transfers, no key
// management, no account creation. each row carries the near-kit toolbox
// `generic_contract_call_fun` shape — contract id, method, args, gas,
// deposit — so the frontend can hand the transactions straight to
// `generic_contract_call_wallet` without reshaping them.
//
// --- WHY --- `contract_id`, `method` and `args` have their OWN columns
// and not one json blob: the plan is to later show "the most common
// contracts and methods" in the ui. a `contract_id` column with an
// index answers "how many queued txs hit ref.finance.near" with a
// `GROUP BY`. inside a json blob it is a json scan on every row, every
// time. `args` stays a json column because it is a bag of arbitrary keys
// with no shape — there is nothing to group by.
//
// --- WHY --- `position` is the order of the transactions: a batch of
// three calls has an order — the deposit comes first, the swap second,
// the withdrawal third — and `position` is that order, `0, 1, 2` within
// the queue.
//
// --- WHY --- `position` is a column and not the rowid: sqlite hands out
// rowids that depend on the insert order and the vacuum state.
// `position` is explicit, and it is what the wallet popup needs — the
// wallet gets the transactions in the order the agent wrote them.
//
// --- WHY --- `tx_id` is a uuid and not `queue_id` + `position`: the
// position is renumbered when a transaction is removed from the middle
// of the batch. a url that named a transaction by its position would then
// point at a different transaction. the uuid does not move.
//
// --- WHY --- `gas` and `deposit` are TEXT and nullable: the toolbox
// takes `number | string` for gas and `number | string | bigint` for
// deposit, and a big deposit does not fit a json number safely. as
// strings both fit, and a call that omits them has no gas of its own.
//
// --- WHY --- `args_base64` is a column of its OWN and not a second
// encoding inside `args`: the two carry different things. `args` is a
// json object with named keys, and `args_base64` is an opaque run of
// bytes that only the contract can read — the FastFS protocol's borsh
// arguments are the case. a column of its own keeps the json object
// readable as json, so the feed's json reads are not asked to look at
// base64.
use sqlx::{Connection, Executor, Row, SqliteConnection};
// ========================================
// --- SCHEMA ----------------------------
// the statement that creates the table and its indexes.
//
// --- WHY --- `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`: it creates the table on a
// fresh db and does nothing on one that already has it.
//
// --- WHY --- the foreign key ON DELETE CASCADE: a transaction without a
// queue is nothing. deleting the queue takes its transactions with it,
// and the transactions take their account rows with them.
//
// --- WHY --- the four indexes, one each for the endpoint that needs it:
// `contract_id` serves "how many txs for this contract" and "the most
// common contracts", `method` serves "the most common methods",
// `queue_id` serves "the transactions of this queue, in order", and
// `created_at` serves the feed list, newest first.

// --- CREATE ----------------------------
// create the tx_queue_transactions table if it is not there yet.
//
// --- WHY --- it runs in a transaction: a half-created table would fail
// the first query against it.
//
// --- WHY --- it runs on every start: the statement does nothing when the
// table already exists, so there is no bookkeeping to say "already
// done" and no state to get out of step with the schema.
//
// --- WHY --- IT ALSO ADDS THE MISSING COLUMNS: this db has no
// migration system, so a db that was created BEFORE a column was added
// would never get it — `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` does nothing to a
// table that already exists. so the columns that were added later are
// added here, one `ALTER TABLE` each, and each one is checked first so
// it does not run on a db that already has it.

// --- ADD ARGS BASE64 ------------------
// add the `args_base64` column to a db that was made before it existed.
//
// --- WHY --- THE COLUMN IS CHECKED FIRST AND NOT CAUGHT AS AN ERROR:
// sqlite has no `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, and an `ALTER TABLE` that
// adds a column that is already there fails with "duplicate column
// name". so the table's columns are read first and the statement only
// runs when the column is missing. that way the same code brings a
// fresh db and an old db to the same shape, and neither of them fails.
//
// --- WHY --- THE CHECK IS ON `pragma_table_info` AND NOT ON A TRY: a
// try would swallow a real failure — a locked db, a full disk — and
// answer "the column is there" when it is not. the pragma says what the
// table's shape IS.
//
// --- WHY --- IT IS CALLED AFTER THE TABLE'S OWN TRANSACTION IS
// COMMITTED: the transaction is already closed by the time this runs,
// and a fresh db has the column from the `CREATE TABLE` above, so this
// statement does nothing there.
