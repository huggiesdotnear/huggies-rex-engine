// SWAP_QUEUE_STORE
// the db access for the swap_queue table. every read and every write of a
// queued swap goes through this file, so the sql lives in one place.
//
// --- WHY --- one row per SWAP and not per transaction: the agent does
// not know the route. it knows the token in, the amount in and the token
// out, and the route is worked out at the moment somebody executes it.
//
// --- WHY --- the `what`, `when` and `why` live on the SWAP: they
// describe the swap, and they are the same three fields the tx queue
// carries, so a reader sees one kind of post whether it is a swap or a
// batch of calls.
//
// --- WHY --- there is NO status column on this table: a queued swap is
// never done. at any moment another account can decide they want it,
// and they join. the status lives on the account row and nowhere else.
//
// --- WHY --- the `when` column is QUOTED in every statement that reads
// or writes it: `when` is a reserved word in sqlite, and an unquoted
// `when` in a column list is a syntax error. `why` and `when_at` are
// ordinary words and are left alone.

// and there is no second sql to keep in step with the first.
//
// --- WHY --- `hide_sent` needs the account: "has this account sent it"
// is a question about ONE account. a swap can be sent by alice and not
// by bob, so there is no such question about all the accounts at once.
// when the caller gives a `hide_sent` with no account, the `NOT EXISTS`
// never matches anything that account did and the filter falls away —
// the ROUTE is where that is refused, because the route knows it was a
// mistake and the store only knows the shape of the data.
//
// --- WHY --- the token filters are plain comparisons and not `EXISTS`
// over another table: the token in and the token out are COLUMNS on the
// swap, not rows on a transaction table. a queued swap has no
// transactions until somebody signs it.
//
// --- WHY --- the order is `created_at DESC`: the list is a feed, and the
// newest swap is the one the reader wants.
//
// --- WHY --- THE ORDER IS `(created_at DESC, swap_id DESC)` AND NOT
// JUST `created_at DESC`: two swaps can be queued in the same
// millisecond, and the cursor that walks this order needs a total one.
// the id breaks the tie in the same direction as the time, so "the rows
